              <h4>BACKSTORY</h4>

              <p>Scottish Indie Rockers Bite Night formed in early 2014 and the
              four piece hit the ground running making it to the final of the
              Highland battle of the bands in their first three gigs amongst
              stiff and far more experienced competition.</p>

              <p>The success of that subsequently led to gaining some great support
              slots namely the bands first appearance at the famous Ironworks
              venue to support the hotly tipped Palma Violets.</p>

              <p>From there on in with gigs all over Scotland and a growing
              confidence the band played to a busy tent at Belladrum Festival,
              not a bad achievement for band who formed only 8 months prior and
              surely a highlight of their journey so far.</p>

            <section class="bio">

              <h4>PRESENT</h4>

              <p>The band have now released a 4 track EP of which one of the tracks
              "Adelaide Eyes" was selected to appear in R2 Magazines un signed
              compilation cd for January 2015.</p>

              <p>The boys also made their first music video with some raunchy
              oiled up wrestling scenes which is sure to turn heads.</p>

              <p>2015 already looks set eclipse 2014s achievements with Brew at the
              Bog festival and a Main Stage slot at Belladrum already in the
              pipeline for the handsome fellas the future is sure bright.</p>
